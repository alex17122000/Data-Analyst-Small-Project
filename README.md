POC Overview

A manufacturing company is modernizing its Procurement systems, but struggles with a messy supplier database full of duplicates and outdated records. Leadership is pushing for a clear cost-saving strategy and is interested in sustainability, but resources are limited.
Theyâ€™re testing two solutions: a strong-performing newcomer and a reputable legacy provider. A decision will be made next quarter.

Tasks:

1. Entity Resolution
Select the best company match (from up to 5 suggestions per row). If none are accurate, leave it unmatched or find the correct one manually.

2. Data QC
Review the matched company data. Highlight any missing or inconsistent fields. Cleaning is optional.

3. Summary
Document your process and insights. Focus on your logic, not just the tools used.
